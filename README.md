# Football-modeling-to-simulate-a-MLS-season
Using historic football results to analyse the Beautiful Game. 
With enough results/scores, one can quantify something as whimsical as home-field advantage. I've performed similar analysis on how the season affects the number of goals
in a game. Or how different is it to host a team from a different conference etc. 
At last, I've trained a machine learning model on various factors (using Dixon and Coles's method) to simaulate an MLS season wherein the final output is the points table at 
the end of the season.
